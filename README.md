This pretty much just creates a text file and when a user inputs username and password it puts the into the file in the format of username,password and this can get taked out by reading the file and splitting the lines where the comma is to read the data. No security measures in it so it kinda sucks but thats why I posted it here.

I also just realized that it only lets you login if the login credentials are the most recently created ones and im working on a fix for that now. I am dumb.
